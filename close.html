<p>
    As you turn to the final page of this book, I want to take a moment to RAMind you that: <font color="#517519">you're now officially a RAMstermind!</font>

    <br> <br> And thank you for your readership because writing this <font color="#517519">'supposed'</font> book has been a commitment for months and considering that most of the information online is crap, i would say without a proper institution it's not easy to look at these things from a 3rd low-level perspective.  So the only viable solution was to take notes from other books which had all the info needed to craft this, and let's not forget the help i got from all the fellow Hack Clubers. Once again, thanks to you and everyone who helped me gather intel for this project. I hope you learned a <font color="#517519">thing</font> or <font color="#517519">two</font> from this as i promised.
<p>
